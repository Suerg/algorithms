## algorithms
Collection of algorithms and data structures, inspired by competitive programming. Most of the material is directly using the book called Introduction to Algorithms, by CLRS. Since this is essentially one of the
most common reference books on algorithms this seems appropriate. I also personally enjoy the style of the book and its in-depth coverage.

## Motivation
I was inspired to start working on algorithms after getting
interested in competitive programming. Since I am interested in
solving programming problems in pure C for the learning experience.
This combination of writing code in C and solving problems requiring
advanced data structures, and my desire to learn, motivated me to
simply start to make my own library of algorithms and data structures.

## Setup
Since I am still developing the basic structure of the project, and as
there is no current use case; other than my own edification and the idea
of eventually using the library to solve programming competition style
problems, there is not much in the way of configuration at this stage.

I have configured the project to use CMake.

So to build simply do:

```
cmake .
make
```
